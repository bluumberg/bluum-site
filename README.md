*/Notes - 4.15.25/*

Domain shoould be working, Deployed through Vercel, bud code gets edited and added via github.
Running on vanilla HTML and CSS. CSS is separated in in different sheets but imported via main.css,
might eventually upgrade to SASS compiler. 
No JS atm but considering updating to injection or playing around with react just to learn, but will-
do so later-half of the year.

Site is still quite buggy and needs some tweakss!!
Issues:
*Mobile Menus - for some reason the menu doesn't hide when viewed on a mobile device at least on Iphone browsers (Brave, Safari)

*Navbar looks off on mobile devices, logo is bleeding over the purple waves causing poor readability.

*Navbar hamburger also has some odd sizing issues.

*Footer needs to be added to about.html (putting it off til the end in case I make tweaks to the original, another reason why
injection might be a good idea.

*Animals are missing in mobile view, purposefully hidden, need to figure out a good placement for these first, but it is a low priority atm.

*Learn more button is still not linked in mobile view, will just link to about page.

*Might create a separate page for Team */still needs to be designed/*

*Current CTA button animation is wack I'm picturing something smoother in mind. low priority 

*Phone Image is a bit blurry in certain screens, might have to use a different mockup as the current one kept pixelating even after switching the image to a higher resolution.

*Alignment Issues - there are some inconsistencies in card sizing in the about page - low priority  

@Emms if you catch any issues yourself feel free to edit the doc or dm on Slack!
